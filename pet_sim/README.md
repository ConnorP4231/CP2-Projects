## Execution and usage

The way to use this project is actually very simple. There are instructions displayed each and every time something happens. Also when you
press the run button, there is a quick sentence on what this program actually is. Just follow the instructions displayed to you and
everything will work fine.

## Author's Information
---
I am a 9th grade programmer who is trying to get by. Coding is really fun for me unless it is an assignment since I like coding when it is chill and relaxed
and you can code at your own pace. Here are the places you can find me at: [GitHub]: (https://github.com/ConnorP4231) or email: connor.pavicic@ucas-edu.net
