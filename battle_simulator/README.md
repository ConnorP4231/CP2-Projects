# Battle Simulator

## Project Description
---
The purpose of this project is to give users a fun and enjoyable battling experience through a coding terminal. This program can do all sorts of things.
It can battle the computer by having you choose a character and the computer chooses one and then you battle it out. The program can also
display statistical graphs like a bar graph of character data, a line graph of XP, etc. Another thing you can do in this program is adding a character.
You can create your own character with its own statistics and everything. Lastly, you can view all the characters.

## Execution and usage

The way to use this project is actually very simple. There are instructions displayed each and every time something happens. Also when you
press the run button, there is a quick sentence on what this program actually is. Just follow the instructions displayed to you and
everything will work fine.

## Current Features
---
+ The first feature I am proud of is the battle portion of it because it is complicated but works great.
+ The second feature I am proud of is the bar graph because it is so cool how code that simple can create a good looking graph.
+ The third feature I am proud of is the character creation because it is cool to sort of manipulate csv files and all that.

## Author's Information

I am a 9th grade programmer who is trying to get by. Coding is really fun for me unless it is an assignment since I like coding when it is chill and relaxed
and you can code at your own pace. Here are the places you can find me at: [GitHub]: (https://github.com/ConnorP4231) or email: connor.pavicic@ucas-edu.net
