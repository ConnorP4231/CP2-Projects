# Coin Change Solver

## Project Description
---
The purpose of this project is to make the user's life easier by telling them least amount of coins/bills and the coins/bills needed from a certain currency and amount. How it works is the program will ask you what country's currency you want to use, then it will ask you the amount, and then finally it will print out the bills/coins, and the amount of bills/coins.

press the run button, there is a quick sentence on what this program actually is. Just follow the instructions displayed to you and
everything will work fine.

## Used technologies
---
No technologies used for this project, only Python.

## Current Features
---
+ The first feature I'm proud of is how the program finds the amount of bills/coins and how it subtracts and goes through each value in the csv file.
+ The second feature I'm proud of is how the program adds the name of the bill/coin to the csv since I put the name and value in a tuple.
+ The third feature I'm proud of is how the name and value of each bill/coin are split and put in a tuple and the put in a csv file to make it easier later on in the code.
