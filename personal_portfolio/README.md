## Author's Information
---
I am a 9th grade programmer who is trying to get by. Coding is really fun for me unless it is an assignment since I like coding when it is chill and relaxed
and you can code at your own pace. Here are the places you can find me at: [GitHub]: (https://github.com/ConnorP4231) or email: connor.pavicic@ucas-edu.net
